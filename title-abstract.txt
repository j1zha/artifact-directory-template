Title:
<Comparing Deep Learning Models for time series prediction>

Abstract:
<Stock price forecasting is a challenging task in financial markets, where volatility and randomness introduce high uncertainty. Traditional models like Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) have been widely used for time series forecasting due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies. However, recent advancements in deep learning, such as transformerbased architectures and probabilistic forecasting models, have introduced more sophisticated methods like Lag-Llama and Time Series Transformer (TST), which can better handle
long-range dependencies and capture uncertainty in predictions.
This study aims to compare the effectiveness of LSTM, Lag-Llama, and Time Series Transformer (TST) in predicting NVIDIA (NVDA) stock prices. We evaluate the models based on
their ability to predict future stock prices and measure their performance using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE) for deterministic forecasts and Continuous Ranked Probability Score
(CRPS) for probabilistic forecasts. Through this comparison, we assess which model is more
suitable for short-term stock price forecasting and uncertainty quantification.>
